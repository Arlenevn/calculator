## Updates

### Update 1: Decimal Precision Enhancement

In the current version, the calculator performs calculations with double-precision floating-point numbers. To enhance decimal precision, we can update the program to use `BigDecimal` for more accurate decimal calculations, especially for financial and scientific applications.

**How to Achieve:** Replace the `double` data types with `BigDecimal` and use the appropriate methods for calculations.

### Update 2: GUI (Graphical User Interface)

To make the calculator more user-friendly, we can create a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing or JavaFX libraries. This will provide a visual interface for users to input numbers and operators and see the results.

**How to Achieve:** Develop a GUI interface using Java Swing or JavaFX libraries and integrate it with the existing logic.
